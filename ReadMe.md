## 1. Introduction

TOPP-DWR is an open-source tool designed to perform **Time-Optimal Path Parameterization (TOPP)** for **Differential Driven Wheeled Robots (DWR)**. The core objective is to compute the minimum time required to traverse a predefined geometric path, while respecting constraints on:
*   Linear acceleration
*   Linear velocity
*   Angular velocity
*   Joint velocity

The algorithm efficiently solves the underlying optimization problem using **Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP)** via the **MOSEK 10.2** solver. Additionally, the open-source solver **ECOS** also supports this SOCP-formulated optimization problem, providing an alternative implementation option for scenarios where open-source tools are preferred.

## 3. Installation

### 3.1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Create a new ROS 2 workspace (if you don't have one)
mkdir -p ~/topp_dwr_ws/src

cd ~/topp_dwr_ws/src

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/liyong2019/TOPP-DWR.git

# Navigate back to the workspace root
cd ..
```

### 3.2. Install MOSEK

* Obtain a License: Register for a free academic license from the [MOSEK website](https://www.mosek.com/products/academic-licenses/).

* Place the License File: After receiving the license file (`mosek.lic`), place the license at /mosek/10.2/:
```bash
# Move your license file to ${PROJECT_NAME}/mosek/10.2/mosek.lic
mv /path/to/your/mosek.lic ${PROJECT_NAME}/mosek/10.2/
```

### 3.3. Build the Package
```bash
# Source ROS 2 environment
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash

</p>

* Launch RViz: Open RViz and load a configuration that displays MarkerArray on the topic trajectory.

* Run the Node:
```bash
# Run with Waypoints from RVIZ and MOSEK C API
./install/topp_dwr/lib/topp_dwr/topp_dwr_node --algo mosek_c --traj c4

# Define Waypoints: Click "2D Pose Estimate" in RViz at least 5 times.
Trigger Generation: Click "2D Pose Estimate" in RViz to start optimization.

# Finish Define Waypoints: Click "2D Goal Pose" in RViz.
Trigger Generation: Click "2D Goal Pose" in RViz to start optimization.   

# Visualize: 
The optimized trajectory "/trajectory" will be displayed in RViz with color-coded velocity.
```

## 5. Configuration
Kinodynamic parameters (max velocity, acceleration, etc.) are loaded from configuration files within the package, based on the selected trajectory type (--traj). Default parameters are used if the config file is not found.
## 6. Acknowledgements

* We use the commercial MOSEK 10.2 library or open source solver ECOS for solving the SOCP problem.
* This is a research code, any fitness for a particular purpose is disclaimed.
* For the sake of code compactness and readability, certain complex implementations have been simplified relative to the original version used in our research. Despite these simplifications, the time of the generated trajectory differs by less than 1% from the results presented in Table I of the associated paper, ensuring consistency with the reported performance.
